This repository contains the code and resources for a system aimed at detecting abusive speech and identifying the speaker in Bangla. The system leverages a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in both tasks.

## Dataset Sources:

### Bangla Abusive Dataset:
- [Bangla Abusive Comment Dataset](https://github.com/aimansnigdha/Bangla-Abusive-Comment-Dataset)
- [Bengali Hate Speech Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naurosromim/bengali-hate-speech-dataset)
- [Bengali Hate Speech Dataset](https://github.com/rezacsedu/Bengali-Hate-Speech-Dataset)

### Speaker Identification Dataset:
- [Speaker Identification Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TNcp6t7_ZJ1E3TDhqZTW_DKhrkXMHbs1)

The system uses a combination of NLP and deep learning techniques to extract features from Bangla text and train models for abusive speech detection and speaker identification.
