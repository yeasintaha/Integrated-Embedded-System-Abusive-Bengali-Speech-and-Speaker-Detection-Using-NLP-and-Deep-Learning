# Bangla Abusive Speech Detection and Speaker Identification

This research work aims to develop a system for detecting abusive speech and identifying the speaker in Bangla. The system is trained on a dataset of Bangla abusive speech and speaker identification data, which has been collected from the following links:

**Bangla Abusive Dataset:**
  - https://github.com/aimansnigdha/Bangla-Abusive-Comment-Dataset <br/>
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naurosromim/bengali-hate-speech-dataset <br/>
  - https://github.com/rezacsedu/Bengali-Hate-Speech-Dataset <br/>

**Speaker Identification Dataset:** 
  - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TNcp6t7_ZJ1E3TDhqZTW_DKhrkXMHbs1

The system uses a combination of NLP and deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in both abusive speech detection and speaker identification. The NLP techniques are used to extract features from the Bangla text, such as the presence of abusive words and phrases, and the syntactic structure of the sentences. The deep learning techniques are used to train a model that can predict whether a given text is abusive and identify the speaker.
